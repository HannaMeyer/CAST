# CAST: Caret Applications for Spatio-Temporal models

Supporting functionality to run 'caret' with spatial or spatial-temporal data. 'caret' is a frequently used package for model training and prediction using machine learning. CAST includes functions to improve spatial or spatial-temporal modelling tasks using 'caret'. To decrease spatial overfitting and to improve model performances, the package implements a forward feature selection that selects suitable predictor variables in view to their contribution to spatial or spatio-temporal model performance. CAST further includes functionality to estimate the (spatial) area of applicability of prediction models.

Note: The developer version of CAST can be found on https://github.com/HannaMeyer/CAST. The CRAN Version can be found on	https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=CAST
