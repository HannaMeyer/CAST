\usage{
aoa(
  newdata,
  model = NA,
  trainDI = NA,
  train = NULL,
  weight = NA,
  variables = "all",
  CVtest = NULL,
  CVtrain = NULL,
  method = "L2",
  useWeight = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{newdata}{A SpatRaster, stars object or data.frame containing the data
the model was meant to make predictions for.}

\item{model}{A train object created with caret used to extract weights from (based on variable importance) as well as cross-validation folds.
See examples for the case that no model is available or for models trained via e.g. mlr3.}

\item{trainDI}{A trainDI object. Optional if \code{\link{trainDI}} was calculated beforehand.}

\item{train}{A data.frame containing the data used for model training. Optional. Only required when no model is given}

\item{weight}{A data.frame containing weights for each variable. Optional. Only required if no model is given.}

\item{variables}{character vector of predictor variables. if "all" then all variables
of the model are used or if no model is given then of the train dataset.}

\item{CVtest}{list or vector. Either a list where each element contains the data points used for testing during the cross validation iteration (i.e. held back data).
Or a vector that contains the ID of the fold for each training point.
Only required if no model is given.}

\item{CVtrain}{list. Each element contains the data points used for training during the cross validation iteration (i.e. held back data).
Only required if no model is given and only required if CVtrain is not the opposite of CVtest (i.e. if a data point is not used for testing, it is used for training).
Relevant if some data points are excluded, e.g. when using \code{\link{nndm}}.}

\item{method}{Character. Method used for distance calculation. Currently euclidean distance (L2) and Mahalanobis distance (MD) are implemented but only L2 is tested. Note that MD takes considerably longer.}

\item{useWeight}{Logical. Only if a model is given. Weight variables according to importance in the model?}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{aoa} containing:
 \item{parameters}{object of class trainDI. see \code{\link{trainDI}}}
 \item{DI}{SpatRaster, stars object or data frame. Dissimilarity index of newdata}
 \item{AOA}{SpatRaster, stars object or data frame. Area of Applicability of newdata.
  AOA has values 0 (outside AOA) and 1 (inside AOA)}
}
\description{
This function estimates the Dissimilarity Index (DI) and the derived
Area of Applicability (AOA) of spatial prediction models by
considering the distance of new data (i.e. a SpatRaster of spatial predictors
used in the models) in the predictor variable space to the data used for model
training. Predictors can be weighted based on the internal
variable importance of the machine learning algorithm used for model training.
The AOA is derived by applying a threshold on the DI which is the (outlier-removed)
maximum DI of the cross-validated training data.
}
\details{
The Dissimilarity Index (DI) and the corresponding Area of Applicability (AOA) are calculated.
If variables are factors, dummy variables are created prior to weighting and distance calculation.

Interpretation of results: If a location is very similar to the properties
of the training data it will have a low distance in the predictor variable space
(DI towards 0) while locations that are very different in their properties
will have a high DI.
See Meyer and Pebesma (2021) for the full documentation of the methodology.
}
\note{
If classification models are used, currently the variable importance can only
be automatically retrieved if models were trained via train(predictors,response) and not via the formula-interface.
Will be fixed.
